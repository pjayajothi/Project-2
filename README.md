# Gobuster

## Objective

Using Gobuster, a software tool to brute force directories on web servers, to see if I can find a list of potential pages or directory names and try accessing a website with each of them.
Note: This activity will be done using a Linux OS VM while trying to complete a challenge from TryHackMe- <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/picklerick">Pickle Rick</a>, A Rick and Morty CTF.  

## Skills Learned
### 1. Penetration Testing & Ethical Hacking Skills
Learning how to enumerate directories and files on a web server.
Identifying hidden files, directories, and endpoints that may reveal vulnerabilities.
### 2. Wordlist Manipulation
Understanding how to select or create effective wordlists for brute-force attacks.
Learning to modify and optimize wordlists for different target environments.
### 3. Web Server Enumeration
Identifying exposed resources like admin panels, configuration files, and sensitive directories.
Recognizing common directory structures used by different web frameworks and CMSs.
### 4. HTTP Protocol & Status Code Interpretation
Learning to analyze HTTP response codes (e.g., 200 OK, 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found).
Understanding server responses to identify potential security misconfigurations.
###5. Automation & Scripting
Running automated scans efficiently using Gobuster.
Integrating Gobuster into scripts for more advanced enumeration tasks.
### 6. Performance Optimization
Learning how to tweak Gobuster parameters like thread count and timeout for faster and more efficient scans.
Avoiding detection by IDS/IPS through rate-limiting and user-agent modification.
### 7. Cybersecurity Awareness
Gaining insight into how attackers discover vulnerabilities.
Understanding the importance of securing web applications against directory brute-forcing attacks.
